Build a recommendation system for the Amazon music rating using the Neural Network Algorithms. The solution was a part of the Kaggle competition. 

•	Implemented RNN – LSTM neural network for the NLP prediction of ratings based on the reviews from training set. 
•	Visualization and EDA performed using seaborn and matplotlib for the genre, ratings, price, and reviews.
•	Scored mean squared error (MSE) of 0.49615 for the final test dataset in the competition.
